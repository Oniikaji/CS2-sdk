# Alysscheat

## Overview

Alysscheat is a simple SDK for CS2, designed primarily for educational purposes. Written in C++ and built with CMake, this project provides a foundation for understanding game hacking and related concepts. **Note:** This SDK is undoubtedly **DETECTED** and should only be used on unofficial servers.

## Features

- Simple Bone ESP (more features will be added in the future)

## Requirements

- **Compiler:** MSVC (Other compilers are not supported due to compatibility issues. Ensure all necessary libraries are provided to CMake to minimize compile errors.)
- **CS2 Game Offsets:** Offsets are not up-to-date and must be updated manually.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alysscheat.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd alysscheat
    ```

3. Build the project using CMake:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    ```

## Usage

- Ensure you are running the SDK on unofficial servers only.
- Update the offsets manually as needed to match the current game version.
